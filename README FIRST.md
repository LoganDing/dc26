DEFCON 26 Workshop Securing Big Data in Hadoop

Welcome to this workshop! My name is Mike Guirao and I will be teaching this workshop at DEFCON 26. This is my third workshop at DC, my very first one was "Memory Forensics with Volatility" at DC24, "Secure Communications in Android with SSL/TLS" at the Crypto & Privacy Village DC25.

So, lets get ready for our workshop!!

First and foremost, you need to get up and running your Docker container. We will be working with Hortonworks Data Platform Sandbox, also known as HDP Sandbox, it is a very handy way of playing with Hadoop that you can run in your laptop.

Make sure to arrive to the workshop day with this container up & running! I will assume that you will arrive to the workshop day with the HDP up & running!
